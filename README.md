# ðŸš€ goup

Simple, platform and shell agnostic installer and version manager for Go.

## Features

- Install, manage and switch between different versions of the Go SDK.
- Multi-shell compatible (Bash, Zsh, Nushell, Powershell)
- Multi-platform compatible (Linux, macOS & Windows).
- Tries to be as simple and "out-of-the-way" as possible.
- Should be pretty fast.
- Uses the precompiled binaries instead of compiling the sources locally.

## Installation

### Install Script

You can use the provided [install script](scripts/install.sh).

> [!WARNING]  
> Please check the install script from the given source URL in the command before executing the command below!

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zekroTJA/goup/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.sh | sudo bash -
```

### Binaries

Simply download the latest binaries from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/zekrotja/goup/releases).

### cargo

Alternatively, you can also install goup using cargo.

```bash
cargo install goup
```

If you want the latest unreleased version from the `master` branch, use the following command.

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/zekroTJA/goup
```

After that, run the following command to setup your environment to use goup to handle your Go versions.
```bash
goup env -p
source ~/.profile
```

This will add the required environment variables and `$PATH` extension to your `.profile` file.

Alternatively, if you just want to fiddle around with the tool, you can also just apply the environment to your current terminal session.

```bash
eval "$(goup env)"
```

## How does it work?

goup uses the [Go Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/golang/go) to query available versions using the `git ls-remote --tags` command *([it is planned](https://github.com/zekroTJA/goup/issues/1) to add a fallback which uses the GitHub API when `git` is not available on the current system)*. This version list is then used to download selected versions from the official download server *(https://go.dev/dl/)*. The downloaded SDKs are then directly un-zipped and un-packed while being downloaded into goup's worksapce directory, which is in the current users home directory at `$HOME/.local/goup`. All downloaded SDK versions are then stored in `$HOME/.local/goup/installations`. When selecting a specific installation version, the location in the installation directory is sym-linked to `$HOME/.local/goup/current` and the selected version is stored in the file `$HOME/.local/goup/.current_version`.

Using the command `goup env -p`, this will set the path of `$HOME/.local/goup/current/go` as your `GOROOT` environment variable and will add `$HOME/.local/goup/current/go/bin` to the beginning of your `$PATH`. This way, goup does not touch your local installation of Go and you cann roll back to before simply by removing the goup entries in your `.profile` and deleting the `$HOME/.local/goup` directory.

## Credits

This tool is very much inspired by the both wonderful tools [Schnitz' fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) and [Rust's rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup).
